# Burlington's E-commerce Problem
This is a research paper and accompanying presentation that proposes a SaaS cloud solution to revitalize Burlington Co.â€™s e-commerce platform sales during the COVID pandemic.

A case study done in Winter 2021, intersecting my major in Applied Computing and my minor in Economics in a unique way. Utilized different Cloud computing and Machine Learning concepts to suggest to Burlington different ways to practice efficient demand forecasting; price optimization; and accurate inventory management.

Associated slides and presentation video accompanying the paper are also uploaded in the repo.
